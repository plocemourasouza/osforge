# Architecture Decision Framework

> "Requirements drive architecture. Trade-offs inform decisions. ADRs capture rationale."

## Core Principle

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."**

- Start simple
- Add complexity ONLY when proven necessary
- You can always add patterns later
- Removing complexity is MUCH harder than adding it

---

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing architecture:

- [ ] Requirements clearly understood
- [ ] Constraints identified
- [ ] Each decision has trade-off analysis
- [ ] Simpler alternatives considered
- [ ] ADRs written for significant decisions
- [ ] Team expertise matches chosen patterns

---

## Context Discovery

Before suggesting any architecture, gather context by asking:

### 1. Scale
- How many users? (10, 1K, 100K, 1M+)
- Data volume? (MB, GB, TB)
- Transaction rate? (per second/minute)

### 2. Team
- Solo developer or team?
- Team size and expertise?
- Distributed or co-located?

### 3. Timeline
- MVP/Prototype or long-term product?
- Time to market pressure?

### 4. Domain
- CRUD-heavy or business logic complex?
- Real-time requirements?
- Compliance/regulations?

### 5. Constraints
- Budget limitations?
- Legacy systems to integrate?
- Technology stack preferences?

## Data Access Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | When NOT to Use | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Active Record** | Simple CRUD, rapid prototyping | Complex queries, multiple sources | Low |
| **Repository** | Testing needed, multiple sources | Simple CRUD, single database | Medium |
| **Unit of Work** | Complex transactions | Simple operations | High |
| **Data Mapper** | Complex domain, performance | Simple CRUD, rapid dev | High |

## Domain Logic Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | When NOT to Use | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Transaction Script** | Simple CRUD, procedural | Complex business rules | Low |
| **Table Module** | Record-based logic | Rich behavior needed | Low |
| **Domain Model** | Complex business logic | Simple CRUD | Medium |
| **DDD (Full)** | Complex domain, domain experts | Simple domain, no experts | High |

## Distributed System Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | When NOT to Use | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Modular Monolith** | Small teams, unclear boundaries | Clear contexts, different scales | Medium |
| **Microservices** | Different scales, large teams | Small teams, simple domain | Very High |
| **Event-Driven** | Real-time, loose coupling | Simple workflows, strong consistency | High |
| **CQRS** | Read/write performance diverges | Simple CRUD, same model | High |
| **Saga** | Distributed transactions | Single database, simple ACID | High |

## API Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use | When NOT to Use | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **REST** | Standard CRUD, resources | Real-time, complex queries | Low |
| **GraphQL** | Flexible queries, multiple clients | Simple CRUD, caching needs | Medium |
| **gRPC** | Internal services, performance | Public APIs, browser clients | Medium |
| **WebSocket** | Real-time updates | Simple request/response | Medium |

## The 3 Questions (Before ANY Pattern)

1. **Problem Solved**: What SPECIFIC problem does this pattern solve?
2. **Simpler Alternative**: Is there a simpler solution?
3. **Deferred Complexity**: Can we add this LATER when needed?

## Red Flags (Anti-patterns)

| Pattern | Anti-pattern | Simpler Alternative |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Microservices | Premature splitting | Start monolith, extract later |
| Clean/Hexagonal | Over-abstraction | Concrete first, interfaces later |
| Event Sourcing | Over-engineering | Append-only audit log |
| CQRS | Unnecessary complexity | Single model |
| Repository | YAGNI for simple CRUD | ORM direct access |
